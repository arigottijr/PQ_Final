For the Lost Children of Paris,Carrie Robbins,Home1,"History-1942-45: Nazis, with help from the Vichy Government, collected French-Jewish schoolchildren and delivered them to Auschwitz. Excellent German record-keeping reveals 11,400 children taken. At the liberation, 200 found alive. This is the story of one classroom’s collection day and its aftermath.

In 2020 the Pandemic gave me license to NOT leave my studio. I unearthed a rare book by a French writer who’d found manifests of these exact children! He wrote to every family, explained he was making a Memorial book of the children. Did anyone have ANY picture of a child “before”? Pictures poured in. Children holding their favorite doll, pet or book. Extraordinary. 1822 pages of photos. I started sketching.

Soon I needed Kleenex. I stopped. Started the next day. No different. The book chronicled happy children, all dead now. Would a play filled with children who are dead by final curtain be watchable?

That Fall, Lincoln Center announced performances of the Bunraku tragedy “LOVE SUICIDES AT SONEZAKI”. Seeing the performance, I realized that French schoolchildren could be ‘Bunraku-esque’. Dressed in authentic outfits of their 1940s childhoods, they would look like real children. Exquisite, hand-crafted puppet children playing out their tragedy just as the Japanese did. Realistic, but not real; less painful to watch.

I started drafting children’s anatomy to build the puppets realistically. This is rare among puppets. We did a ZOOM Reading (2021) with wonderful responses! I liked ZOOM’s
closeups & wondered if I could combine ZOOM with VIDEO inserts. I called it “Zoom-Filmic”.

I added a friend on saw, the saw being the closest to the sound of the human voice.
Beautiful and rare.

Othello,Elizabeth Wislar,Home2,"From Tara Moses’ Adaptation

TIME: The year is 2176 just after the final battle in the War of Restoration to disestablish the United
States and restore full sovereignty to Native Nations.

PLACE: Fully restored Indian Territory

This production is a RARE vision and celebration of Indigenous Futurism aligned with Black Liberation.

Tara spoke a bold dream into reality and then used the plot of Othello to explore the imperfections of racial realities, and the historical/ongoing threats to Indigenous women. Tara lead the entire process with what she called Creative Sovereignty.

Each cast member and I spoke in depth about their own personal identities, tribal affiliations or racial heritage, and how they saw their characters dressed in the year 2176. Many of the choices were made together and I was able to infuse their clothing with silhouettes, symbols, and significance from their own cultural and gendered identities.

This production was RARE because no new materials were used. All costume pieces, and the renderings, were made from found/sourced items. Everything we need already exists. We must learn to work in regenerative (rather than extractive) ways if we are to honor the future generations, as well as the land, the air, and the water we share with our plant and animal cousins.

The script was infused with Native American references, language, and perspectives. The female characters were strengthened, and the violence was minimized, as a way of honoring a belief that there will be less violence in the future. Red fabric ribbons were used for blood when three flesh wounds occurred. For the three deaths, shimmering scarves pulled from the costumes, nodded to the Lakota and Cherokee practice of prayer ties.","South Dakota Shakespeare Festival

8 Dissolutions,Erik Bergrin,Home3,"At the end of one’s life, the body and mind go through 8 different stages, according to Buddhist philosophy. The first 4 stages are connected with an element and a sense perception shutting down. For example, the first dissolution is the disappearing of the earth element. The body becomes heavier, you are unable to move your arms, and your sight starts to go. The second is the dissolving of the water element. The fluids of the body dry up, accompanied by loss of hearing. The third dissolution is associated with fire and smell and the 4th with air and taste. After the 5 senses and 4 elements are gone, the next phase of the process is about a slow realization into emptiness. There is a visualization meditation you can do to take you through this process. This work was made during my covid quarantine period. Seeing all of the morgue trucks, knowing people who died, the protests, the president, riots, it caused me to want to create a body of work that would force me to go deep and learn to appreciate everything
around me. I practiced the 8 Dissolutions meditation repeatedly in order to visualize the textures of the pieces.

For me, each dissolution is also associated with a sound, and a mudra, (or hand gesture.) I noticed while practicing the meditation, my hands always went into a certain position. The mudras were photographed and printed on fabric and made into dresses which hung behind each sculpture piece during the exhibition.

Along with the concept, the materials also are part of the theme RARE. I grew and developed a lot of the textiles in the pieces. Some of the materials include a leather like textile from kombucha scobies that I spent a year growing, a textile derived from sodium alginate seaweed, melted bismuth to crystalize charms, embedded handmade drums into the bodies, grew crystals all over areas of pieces, hammered aluminum, fabric that came from compressed bark trees, and fiber techniques such as coiling, felting, and weaving.

My artwork is all about confronting shadows buried in my subconscious. By doing this act, I can turn these shadows into physical objects, and face them in a tangible form, in order to change them. The 8 DIssolutions meditation is a way to bring up these shadows. Studying Buddhist philosophy and meditation, and having a background in fiber art, and costume design, I combine all of these to do this introspective investigation.","The 8 Dissolutions was first shown at The Morris Museum – NJ, USA

Acquittal,Hyun Sook Kim,Home4,"Acquittal weaves together the story of four women unjustly imprisoned in Pakistan during General Zia-ul-Haq’s discriminatory Hudood Ordinances: Zahida, an activist jailed for her political activity; Marium, a pregnant rape victim in prison because she refused an abortion; Jamila, a woman denied divorce by Islamic law, who murdered her abusive husband; and Jannat Bibi, incarcerated in place of her son for theft. In this bleak 1980s prison, the women forge a bond that transcends their differences in class, ideology, and religious practice.

Pan Asian is the pioneer Asian American theater in New York City, the second most veteran in the nation, and is at the forefront of promoting pan-Asian cultural stories previously unseen on the American stage. It was founded in 1977 by Tisa Chang with the vision that Asian American artists can equally follow their artistic aspirations to reach the zenith in American theater. Its mission is to provide professional theatre opportunities for diverse Asian American artists to work under the highest standards of excellence and create new works that dignify and dispel stereotypes, focusing on stories of probing social justice issues. Pan Asian’s artistic distinction is seen in Off -Broadway productions, tours, educational outreach, and community service.

In its 41st milestone season, I designed Acquittal for the NYC Pan Asian Rep Theatre. The background was the early 1980s when General Zia-ul-Haq ruled with the blatant ‘Islamic’ laws in Pakistan, which discriminated women and minority groups. The show focuses on 4 women in a Pakistan prison in the 1980’s and how each represents a different injustice. As a minority female, I was glad to present the themes of discrimination and social injustice in the American Theatre. My design was to research the historical context, present the appropriate form and ecological natural fabric in costumes. I utilized darker reddish color-tone to show their enraged psychological suffering. This show and my design was selected and presented in The Consortium of Asian American Theaters & Artists CAATA/CONFEST 2018 in the event of The 6th National Asian American Theater Conference & Festival at Victory Gardens Theater, Chicago.","Victory Gardens Theater Chicago, IL

Mad Dash Le Cirque,Jazz,Home5,"This submission pertains to the weekly drag show that I directed over the summer of 2021, titled Mad Dash: Le Cirque. The show had 12 iterations. Points of reference which relate to “Rare” are derived from ideas of ephemera, traveling shows, and the evolution of figures of comedic relief, ranging from harlequin court jesters, to mime/clowncore, and how they relate to our (my) performance of our (my) queerness/transness. The ensemble consists of a patchwork argyle chiffon dress embellished with twenty faux-fur tassels, multi colored pailletes, micro-sequin fringe, freshwater pearl & hematite spaghetti straps, a Burgundian Hennin inspired red velvet conical hat with chiffon streamers, and a set of custom jewelry.

The compressed timeframe for preparing a costume wardrobe for two performers, in an ever changing, themed weekly show is one of the fundamental conditions that relate to themes of rarity. The design process became a representation of my material ecosystem, calling upon questions of access, budget, and scarcity (scarcity of funding, materials, and time; time for fittings, finishings, and alterations) In New York we are fortunate to have access to some of the most comprehensive material landscapes imaginable. This allows for radical ideation, even within the confines of a limited window of time/limited access to capital. Designing within these restrictions complicated the wardrobe and styling decisions making process, affecting outcomes related to choreography, synchronicity, ideas of accessorizing, or the function of accessories/props/performative tools)

To bring focus to our incredibly open performative prompt during that weekly period, we developed an accumulating archive of reference images. This helped us plan for upcoming themes, and narrow our choices as they would relate to specific musical genres. For example, we had a Country Western themed week inspired by the Dolly Parton album titled “Halos and Horns”, for which I designed a very fitted ankle length column gown with a built in step-in-body ( prosthetic breasts, waste cincher to mimic Dolly) because I knew that my choreography would be predominantly static, relying on myself singing live. For this submission, the Le Cirque outfit, I took into consideration a desire for broad dramatic forms of movement.","Wilson Lives BK

Superterranean,Olivera Gaijic,Home6,"SUPERTERRANEAN by Pig Iron Theatre Company – A large-scale work of visual theatre inspired by urban infrastructure and its effect on the human body.

Refineries, dams, and wastewater treatment plants tower over us and sprawl beneath us. These massive works of infrastructure seem almost anti-human in their complexity and scale—like machines that run themselves—but they are the beating hearts that allow a city to function.

A world premiere by Pig Iron Theatre Company, Superterranean is a new work of visual theatre driven by Mimi Lien’s fascinations with urban infrastructure acting in concert with the human body.

On the outskirts of an unknown city, massive structures emerge from the murk. Here, nine performers embody our hunger for permanence, our dreams of utopia, and the melancholy contemplation of our skin, our organs, and our deepest urges.”

https://www.pigiron.org/productions/superterranean

Looking back that we made this piece in pre covid times it is quite eerie. Superterrenean is a premonition of the time that will come. The filling of loneliness and the smallness of humans among these giant cement structures. The feeling of insolation that is evoked in this spa-like place, people doing mundane activities that are now not acceptable, like breathing the same air…faceless people in a Biohazard protective hazmat suits hugging, and disinfecting this place after human use. This theatre piece had quiet tension on something that is about to erupt, holding a tremor of all the hysteria that will come and change us forever.","PHILADELPHIA FRINGE FESTIVAL

Ocean Filibuster,Olivera Gaijic,Home7,"Commissioned and developed by the American Repertory Theater with support from the Harvard University Center for the Environment.

Ocean Filibuster is an immersive musical experience that explores the vast depths crucial to our daily survival, and its goal is to depict the reality of the climate crisis. Climate change is causing irreparable damage to farmland, cities, and coastlines. This is a collective problem and requires everyone’s awareness and engagement to save this planet.

PearlDamour started developing the show pre-covid. We continue working on it during this time wich effects certainly further influenced the show. Making art that can educate people and bring awareness of the state of our planet felt more than urgent. This resulted in visually impactful production that affected both people’s minds & hearts.

I am mesmerized by the immense beauty of the Ocean, its quaintness and strength… its habitat, and its colors, textures, and species. Its beauty is epic! My color is the color of the sea, I belong to it! The ocean is part of us as we are part of it! … I wanted to return the colors to the ocean by making recyclable art. That was my humble way of saving the Ocean! My small steps of collecting the plastic bottles and making hundreds of organic shapes out of them to recreate oceans flora give me a purpose during these 2 covid years. Making the Ocean out of objects that pollute it gave me a dual purpose, both to contribute to saving the ocean and also fulfilling my life purpose of making art that was essential for my survival during these times.","American Repertory Theater

King Lear,Susan Tsu,Home8,"The emotional journey of a king divesting his kingdom of worldly goods and military might- first willingly, then in fits of anger- is not unfamiliar to any aging parent who has downsized and been treated like a child by their own children. In 2019, Quantum Theatre, Pittsburgh’s brilliant site-specific, nomadic theatre company, paired this great Shakespearean play with the Carrie Blast Furnace, one of the only surviving pre-WWII blast furnaces in the United States.

This rare and singular coupling was set on acres of riverfront landscape largely returned to nature, the magnificent, rusting behemoth yawns like a primordial dinosaur, recalling for Pittsburghers, their once heralded fame as the world’s largest producers of steel. Backed by the monstrous blast furnace towering over the actors, our King Lear began with the urgent union call of “Which Side Are You On?” sung by Monteze Freeland, who played Kent.

The major themes of Shakespeare’s play: questions of filial piety, loyalty, worth, identity through possessions and military might, power, control, how to tease out truth, how to recover oneself after loss…all came to be doubly considered not only from the point of view of the play, but also from the point of view of Pittsburgh history, economy, ego and pride. The event became a rare self-reckoning. The gauntlet was doubly thrown. Two great histories. Two great tragedies. Wisdom forged by unspeakable sorrow cleared a path toward enlightenment.

Listen- and you can hear the wind that tore through the interior of steel mills between workers. Close your eyes, and you can see the molten steel splashing onto the worker’s boots and catching them on fire. Listen again, and the bass clang of metal against metal deep in the belly of the beast reverberates and sets the scene….","CARRIE BLAST FURNACE- PITTSBURGH, PA

Marie and Rosetta,Anne McMills,Home9,"I believe in producing important stories that reveal well-rounded, informative, and captivating work revolving around the global majority. I have been fortunate enough to work on productions that extend this outlook as a lighting designer.

Please refer to my website here: www.annemcmillslighting.com

It is ideal to tell stories of the global majority without focusing on trauma, but instead celebrating all humans as humans with human stories. Casting can be a way to celebrate members of the global majority by normalizing mixed skin tones, races, and ethnicities within a piece. In my website I showcase two productions with open casting approaches: The Last Five Years and Sense and Sensibility. Productions that choose to be mindful about casting promote this value of normalcy.

Also telling important and forgotten stories is another method of showcasing the global majority, which has been missing in traditional theatre for so long. I was the lighting designer for Marie and Rosetta – a play about two forgotten, black, rock-n-roll icons who largely influenced the emergence of white rock-n-roll. Being able to work on productions like these that celebrate people and cultures that have been largely forgotten creates design as activism. Marie and Rosetta brings awareness to these real, historical icons – Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Marie Knight – that many have not heard of. Because they are black women, they did not get the same attention as individuals like Elvis and Johnny Cash, whose work they influenced. In fact, Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first person to stand and sing in front of her band while playing guitar. This is something that has become a staple of the rock-n-roll world, but is typically not recognized as being originated by a black woman. Marie and Rosetta also explores the love affair that these two partners allegedly developed throughout the years. Being able to celebrate a wonderful LGBTQIA+ story in addition to a powerful play about black historical figures cements this play as an important work.

More work like this needs to continue to be produced. Designing them and bringing attention to them is a form of activism.","Cygnet Theatre – San Diego, CA

Revival,Daisy Long,Home10,"REVIVAL was originally conceived in the spring of 2020, before the world shut down, as an intimate chamber opera about queer love called ANTIOCH MASS. The show never happened, and when the Shed suggested we do it in June 2021, Covid restrictions meant we would be in their massive glass-walled space facing Hudson Yards rather than the small theater we had originally been assigned. It was clear that ANTIOCH MASS could not happen there, and so the piece became something very different: a stirring one-night-only ritual for personal and collective liberation with a full community choir, with the structure modelled on that of a church revival. Some of the songs from ANTIOCH ended up in the show and some did not, and some new songs were written specifically for the new piece.

The show is rare because it elevates community in a time of strife and division. It is designed to meet people in their sorrow and offer a path to joy and collective celebration. Toward the end of the service, singers, choir and audience come together to speak the words of Assata Shakur: “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” This mantra is, essentially, the guiding thesis for the show and one of the reasons it resonates.

REVIVAL was done again at the Shed in June 2022 and will return in 2023 and 2024 both at The Shed and elsewhere. Photos submitted are from the original 2021 production.

Lizzie,Maranda DeBusk,Home11,"Lizzie Borden took an ax. Gave her mother 40 whacks. When she saw what she had done, gave her father 41.

As contemporary audiences, we know the two-dimensional portrait of Lizzie Borden. The young woman in the late 19th century who allegedly violently murdered her parents. The rock opera sensation, LIZZIE, calls into question that narrative. Did she murder her father and stepmother? Most likely. But she has her reasons.

Looking through a modern lens, LIZZIE focuses on the victim’s journey of a young woman trapped in the Victorian era with no way out. Abused by her father, trapped in an uncaring home, unable to love the woman with whom she had grown so close – Lizzie Borden is crushed beneath the weight of an unbearable pressure for which there is only one remedy – murder.

LIZZIE captures what it means to be bound so tightly that you erupt. And once in the freefall, find peace.

The lighting and the score combine to act as an ephemeral representation of Lizzie’s inner turmoil. Filled with saturate color and wicked guitar solos, this piece allows for the visceral interpretation of emotional angst and agony in a fundamentally felt way. Sudden movements, larger-than-life builds, targeted lights that blind the audience and pull them back onto the stage – all combine in a novel way that uses 21st-century technology to tell an eternal story – the story of someone who others refuse to see, someone who reaches a breaking point and takes back their freedom.","Actors Express

The Royale,Minjoo Kim,Home12,"This story is inspired by real-world boxer Jack Johnson who, as a Black man, became the heavyweight champion of the world. Johnson was repeatedly refused a shot to compete for the world heavyweight title because of his race.

Jack lived life loudly. And he had every right to. But the world wasn’t ready. So what does it mean when YOU are ready to live out your greatness and take up space, but there are stop signs in every direction? I think often of Jack’s strength and resilience. No one should have to be that strong. But he was.

Lighting expresses the golden rhythm of the language with body percussion added to the mix. It highlights rhythmic energy flows and reinforcement of language.

Audiences share Jay(the main character inspired by Jack Johnson)’s physical flow, his musical anthem, the way the language rolls off the tongue, how he sees the world, how he feels the world, and how he lives in his own body.

Bold angles of lighting are shaping fully realized and expressive humans that have access to their most expansive selves. Choosing a strong angle creates long shadows and sharp shades on the actors. By sculpting the actor’s body, it highlights the energy that comes from their physical movement and portrays the fight against the nasty and brutal structure of white supremacy.

With Nina’s entrance, the lights open up space and the audience sees their bare world.
Before her emergence, the energy magnitude of each environment is small, and the lighting iris in tight on the body movement. And it explodes with the energy that Nina is bringing to Jay’s world. It demonstrates Nina as the power of female existence by bringing her as a woman of all black history.",Minjoo Kim,12,Light Design
Frankenstein,William Kirkham,Home13,"Set in the Villa Diodati on the night of the storytelling competition that birthed Frankenstein; David Catlin’s original adaptation anchored the classic tale in the life of its author Mary Shelley. A band of five friends personify all of the characters, as Mary conjures Victor Frankenstein and his creature, drawing inspiration from the loss and pain in her own life.

In telling this epic story with a cast of 5 in a single static scenic environment the production allowed audiences to connect more personally with the story. All design areas worked with strong but simple gestures to enhance the productions use of sweeping movement sequences and poetic imagery. Simultaneously, the design worked to support the many layers of narrative storytelling – from the confinement of the Villa, to the cold open bareness Arctic where a dying Victor Frankenstein recounts his tale, as well as the many locations and emotional spaces of the original story.

As a production taking place in the final months before the global pandemic, this design brought a community together around a campfire to hear a ghost story. These moments of connection were RARE in the time before the pandemic, but now are even more appreciated.","Lookingglass Theatre Company

A small group of artists make their home in the beating heart of the city-a converted storage shed atop a building. The surrounded is defined by a mirror as cold as winter, beautiful and terrible. The scenic environment in this international collaboration between an American director, an American scene designer, Korean costume and lighting designers was born out of the question: what will the world look like to the poor in a future Bohemian Paris? This is a world where the cities are driven to bitter cold by a climate crisis, and cause bitter social unrest and war which leads to massive population shifts that re-shape the world. This production strips the idealized romance of this opera away, and yet the small lit candle of love between two people gives the Bohemians a reason to press on.","Daejeon Arts Center

Seven Deadly Sins,Christopher and Justin Swader,Home15,"In the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Miami New Drama artistic director Michel Hausmann conceived a socially-distanced outdoor theatrical event that transformed the windows of vacant storefronts along the outdoor mall of Lincoln Road in Miami Beach into seven different performance spaces. A diverse group of playwrights were commissioned to each write a short play centered around one of the seven deadly sins. With actors performing inside behind glass, audiences in small groups of twelve rotated to each piece and experienced it through headphones on the pedestrian walkway.

The design spanned across four different buildings within a one-block radius. One empty retail space was subdivided for three plays, a recently-closed Nespresso store was split in half to house two plays, a vacant restaurant was redressed as a 1970s bar, and the double doors of the historic Colony Theatre’s loading dock were opened to reveal the set for a piece set in an abstracted Carnegie Hall. Due to the limitations of the sizes and capabilities of these found spaces, it was a very close collaboration with Yuki Nakase Link, the lighting designer and technical team to artfully convert them into temporary performance venues.

At the time it was presented, this was the largest Actors’ Equity approved live event happening in the country. Miami New Drama’s innovative solution to making art safely in the midst of a pandemic employed over 100 artists and was a reminder of how fulfilling live performance can be, especially at a time when people were hungry for human connection and community.","Miami New Drama / Lincoln Road storefronts / Miami,FL

A Dozen Dreams,Irina Kruzhilina,Home16,"A Dozen Dreams was created in response to the prompt: “What are you dreaming of?” It was described by the NY Times critic Maya Phillips as “Part art installation, part immersive theater, En Garde Arts’ endlessly intriguing A Dozen Dreams takes audience members on a self-guided audio tour through the pandemic dreams of 12 female playwrights, rendered in a dozen rooms exquisitely designed to replicate the surreal, chameleonic chambers of the mind at rest.”

This immersive piece utilized the notion of dreams to reflect on the psychological impact of the pandemic on our subconscious. A dozen female playwrights expressed their fears, anxieties and hopes for a post-pandemic world. They shared stories of resilience and imagining a better future; dreams of flying, distant travel, and grappling with being an artist during the societal reckonings of 2020.

As co-creator and leading designer of the project, Irina Kruzhilina led a team of 4 female designers to transform the playwrights words into a dozen expressive scenographic environments. Irina Kruzhilina was responsible for the visual and environmental design, Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew designed the lights, Brittany Bland created video, and Rena Anakwe designed sound. 

The spaces were linked together in a serpentine dreamland, which spectators – equipped with personal headphones -experienced through immersive soundscapes of the playwrights’ voices, each narrating their own dream.

Each dream was a uniquely designed environment. Ellen McLaughlin’s words became an abandoned theater with a distressed dressing room. Caridad Svich’s text was transformed into a corridor enveloped by walls created from broken Plexiglas and semi-translucent sculptured fabric. Liza Jessie Peterson prompted a space filled with tilting classical pillars, suggesting a world in collapse, while Ren Dara Santiago’s space featured a projection of the playwright reflected in a pool of water. Lucy Thurber’s dream offered hopes through a dimensional setting sun posed against a proscenium. A Dozen Dreams was more than translating dreams into a spatial form. It was a piece of its time. The global pandemic challenged us to re-contextualize our artistic practice in many ways, questioning the idea that a relation of co-presence between live actors and spectators is a fundamental aspect of theatrical performance. This powerful scenographic performance installation gave the audience a chance, in a socially-distanced world, to experience some of the most powerful articulators of our time reflect upon our world today.","Created by Anne Hamburger, John Eisner and Irina Kruzhilina

Angels in America,Michael Ruiz del Vizo,Home17,"Tony Kushner wrote Angels in America as an examination of politics and homosexuality in America during the AIDS epidemic that killed generations of queer people. And still, the story and themes are just as relevant today. One can draw similarities between the HIV/AIDS Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, with a close examination of America’s far-right government leaders and their disregard for the lives of their most disenfranchised citizens. My design focuses on humanity’s ever-changing nature and plays on the ideas of construction, destruction, renovation, restoring, and destroying.

For Part One, Millennium Approaches, we see a theatre under construction/renovation. A large exoskeleton, with an oculus, reaches over the acting space, with scaffolding flanking the rest of the stage. The BAM Harvey Theatre was an essential component of the design because the theatre has a history of reconstruction and rehabilitation, which lead to embracing the historic space. The backwall takes a prominent visual role, and invited the rest of the theatre to take take part in the story, The scenery also reaches beyond proscenium and over the audience to immerse the viewer and bring the story’s action closer to the audience. As the destruction of Part One builds up, it reaches the climax when our Angel finally visits and burst through the ceiling. This leads into Part Two, Perestroika, where the rest of the action of the play takes place on top of the destruction left behind.

When I choose to design Angels in America, I didn’t know how important it was for me to design it. The little queer history we are taught is often sanitized and white-washed, so when researching for this show- during a time of civil unrest and relearning- I made a deeper connection to my queer elders and learn more about our queer history.

Designing this show helped me confront my feelings of isolation and loneliness during the pandemic, which allowed me to heal in ways that I wasn’t conscious about.

Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven,Narelle Sissons,Home18,"The NYT review captures the feeling of the actors, design and production very well:

“Messy, noisy, overwhelming life rushes up and down the aisles of the Linda Gross Theater in Manhattan. It would be impossible, after all, for any single stage to contain the heaving humanity of Stephen Adly Guirgis’s Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven, which opened on Monday night. The private conflicts so vibrantly embodied here have a way of sloshing out of Narelle Sissons’s capacious, multi chambered set and flowing to the back of the theater. The many, many characters in this production, residents of a New York City shelter for homeless and abused women, are repeatedly asked to keep their business — their fights, their lovemaking, their drinking and drugging — off the streets and out of public view…”

-Ben Brantley
My scenic design fills the space in the same way that Stephen’s play comes right at you. The multi-sectional aspects of the play bring the world of the city into the theatre, showing the vulnerability of humanity at its most critical. Stephens plays are RARE, they capture our society in a way that is humorous and dangerous at the same time. I made sure the design kept up, and set the play in a cross-section of a huge NYC Upper West Side building. The walls are incomplete, allowing for vulnerability, asking the question; is the space closing in or falling away? Another RARE aspect of the design is my work with the actors, together we made artwork, self-portraits and puppets in character to fill the institutional walls. We spent a day in rehearsal making art and then through performed discussions examined Stephen’s characters as a group; Latino, Latinx, Black, White, LGBTQ and their relationships – moments and stories were funny and often heartbreaking. The characters emphasized their diversity in their art and the director, John and I encouraged everyone to dive into this work fully. Self-portraits and puppets were placed on the walls of the set, everything was revealed and fragile in contrast to the hugeness of space.","Atlantic Theatre – NYC

Port of Entry,Scott Neale,Home19,"Port of Entry invites you to step inside the stories of immigrants from all parts of the world as they forge new lives within the walls of a single apartment building in one of the country’s most diverse immigrant communities: Chicago’s Albany Park. You won’t find this immersive performance on a stage; instead, Port of Entry unfolds across the three floors of a re-created apartment building in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood. Co-created by Albany Park Theater Project and Third Rail Projects and performed by APTP’s youth ensemble, Port of Entry will take you on a journey through time and across cultures, welcoming you into the lives of people who have made this place their home over the span of a century.

Currently in development for the 2022/23 season, Port of Entry is the newest collaboration between Albany Park Theater Project and Third Rail Projects, the co-creators of 2016’s Learning Curve.

Because this production explores the question of “What is home?” with the framework of immigration, neighbors, connections and separation, and cross-cultural diffusion, I feel that it really has the potential to be a catalyst for change, hope and possible futures, and a suitable match for having a presence at PQ23. The whole entire concept of immigration in and of itself is centered around the basic human state of mind that is hope.

At Last I Came to the Seas,Szu-Feng Chen,Home20,"The production was commissioned for the Huayi International Chinese Festival of Arts in Singapore. Inspired by the six roots of sensation in Buddhist philosophy, it was a questioning of one’s cultural identity and a search for a moment of equilibrium in the current world. Told through characters as multi-layered artistic expressions traveling through six intertwined stories, each complex emotion had its own distinct journey.

The project began with the themes of travel, diaspora, and migration, exploring vulnerability, aggression, and impact of history and environment on one’s identity. It was developed through a series of workshops with artists who shared common cultural backgrounds and similar immigration experiences from different countries. Over two years, theatre artists from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, the Netherlands, and the U.S. responded to the ideas of “finding roots versus transplant/immigration” and “nationalities versus ethnicities” with their personal stories and family histories, from which the scenes, actions, movements, and visual designs for the production were developed.

Inspired by the philosophy of I Ching (The Classic of Changes), the performance design showcased a morphing process of one’s identity and assimilation in the context of diaspora. Yin and Yang-shaped sceneries moved in a cohesive flow, transforming the space for the journeys of the Sentimental, the Absurdist, and the Futuristic. Brush stroke- shaped drapes echoed the images of water, showcasing multimedia projections that represented space and time. The characters navigated through the unknown, experienced depression and aggression, and found their way and their place in the scheme of things. The costume design featured the contrast between chaos-neutral and exaggerated styles, showcasing the distinctions between inner identities and outer representations.","Huayi International Chinese Festival of Arts

Photograph 51,Arnel Sancianco,Home21,"Photograph 51, by Anna Ziegler, tells the historical story of Dr. Rosalind Franklin, the female scientist who’s knowledge of X-Ray technology developed the first clear image of DNA. Simultaneously, Ziegler’s adaptation follows a trio of male scientists, Dr. James Watson, Dr. Francis Crick, and Dr. Maurice Wilkins who notoriously “stole” Franklin’s photo to create the premiere model of DNA, thus winning themselves the Nobel Prize.

It was important to this production that the space evoke a feeling of surveillance, a sensation that this chorus of men were looking down on Dr. Franklin as she ventured toward the rare discovery that would forever change science. This sensation is a feeling all too familiar to marginalized individuals who find themselves suddenly placed in a position of power and leadership. “Glass Cliff” is a phrase used today to describe this phenomena. This term describes instances when women (and currently LGBTQ & BIPOC individuals) are put into high positions during moments of high stress and while are expected to succeed are set up to fail.

To illustrate this idea through design, we looked at spaces where surveillance was built into the architecture and ultimately landed on the institutional shape of prison panopticons. These circular spaces were designed as a way to observe prisoners from a single citadel. It was from that foundation that I designed Dr. Franklin’s lab and crafted a space that felt cage and prison-like. The series of windows highlighted a notion of display while the moiré of intersecting mullions crafted a dizzying array of geometry and wonder that gave Paul Deziel’s projections a base to work off of.

My design captures the rareness of discovery and inspiration while also acknowledging the rarity of opportunity and equity for women in science and leadership.","Court Theatre

The Hammer and the Feather,Christian Frederickson,Home22,"The Hammer and the Feather began with a basic curiosity about gravity: what IS this force that shapes so much of our experience of the universe? Research led us to the history of scientific inquiry and how it parallels (and conflicts with) spiritual inquiry. We use the architecture of a requiem mass as a structural and conceptual framework to create a contemplative and spiritual environment where the audience can connect with large questions and pursue their own inquiries into the nature of existence. Bridging humanistic and scientific inquiry, the piece uses gravity as a poetic and conceptual departure point for musical, visual, and sonic material. There are no words in the piece but the material is inspired by universal themes contained in the text of a mass. For example, the text of a Kyrie, “God have mercy”, inspires the second movement, Endless Fall, which is about the feeling all people share of not measuring up, of needing mercy in their life. We are all equally affected by gravity, which was theorized by Galileo in 1638 and proved by astronaut David Scott when he dropped a hammer and a feather on the moon in 1971 (they landed simultaneously).

Five projection surfaces and 21 speakers make this a singular experience of theatrical design; The Hammer and the Feather is installation as performance. We included live musical performance for the premiere, but it functions equally well as an installation. The design IS the experience, and audiences can navigate it, experience it, and discover meaning in it on their own terms. It was originally scheduled to premiere in the spring of 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant that we couldn’t have a live audience. We discussed creating a VR version of the piece in order to stay on schedule, but our central inspiration was to create a large-scale environment with spatial audio and video projections that audiences could walk around in and experience from different perspectives. We made the difficult decision to postpone, to wait until people could be in a room together again and it finally premiered on May 4th, 2022.","MIT Theater Arts

Saints,Cristian Amigo,Home23,"CHASING ANDY WARHOL, a new, devised immersive production exploring the mystery and psychology of Andy Warhol’s curation of his social image, emerged as an artistic innovation out of the health and safety requirements of the COVID pandemic. One of the few live theater experiences in New York City when it first was created and workshoped, it was immediately clear that invention and a new method of visual storytelling were demanded as the audience “chased” multiple “Warhols” through 17 locations over two miles in the iconic Warhol stomping grounds: the East Village. The creative process for this show was unique in that the chosen locations inspired the development of the scenes and choreography rather than the more usual circumstance where the story and script inspire the design. New York City and iconic areas of Warhol’s life became a true design partner. When CHASING ANDY WARHOL was designed there was no script, nothing was permanent, and as the peoples’ reactions and behaviors organically evolved what the design could be and how it could best serve the experience. It was a process of distillation as over six months’ iterations would be teched, tested, and then re-devised and redesigned. It was invigorating to design and then step away and re-approach. Like this production, the future of theater design will benefit from fluid thinking and a process of artistic incubation to ensure the provocative ideas and feelings evoked by performances are experienced by the audiences regardless of being in a conventional theater. The production created a thought-provoking parallel between the persona Warhol used to mask his authentic self and how we similarly control and curate our own public image through social media, especially during the COVID lockdown. The culminating scene in particular solidified this central dramatic question depicting Andy Warhol in the afterlife eating a rotisserie chicken while live feed projection surrounds him and the audience with an ever-updating deluge of live posts hash-tagged Andy Warhol. CHASING ANDY WARHOL leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are not chasing Warhol, instead we are Andy Warhol curating our own social image for the world to consume.","Various locations and streets in the Lower East Side of Manhattan

Resounding World,Megumi Katayama,Home24,"This is an installation piece that tells the story of human history through original music composition created with sampled soundscapes from around the world, space design using various musical instruments to create a rough world map and immersive sound design with speakers and exciters attached to music instruments, art pieces, and other objects around the room. Since each speaker and exciter had a track that was unique to that speaker, people walked around to find the mix they like. Also, some speakers/drivers had elements that react to sounds to achieve visualization of the sound in an “analog” way.

The piece started as an exploration of studying music from different cultures and finding how to achieve a true “cross-cultural” composition. Rather than imitating different music from different parts of the world using music theory knowledge, I focused on understanding the philosophy and cultural background of why the music might have certain characteristics in different parts of the world.

It led me to realize that everything I do as a Japanese immigrant in the US is always cross-cultural, unique, and “rare” by nature, and therefore I decided to submit this piece.","Composition & Sound Design

Theater in Quarantine,Joshua Gelb,Home25,"Established in response to the pandemic, Theater in Quarantine transformed an 8 sq. foot closet into a digital performance laboratory, attracting over 100 different collaborators, live-streaming dozens of original works, and reaching a global audience. In The New York Times Jesse Green called it “a new genre entirely.” The complete Theater in Quarantine archive remains available to view on YouTube.

Our performance space is a closet. It measures four feet wide by eight feet tall, and is only two feet deep. Our digital proscenium is effectively the same aspect ratio as an iphone and, like the conferencing boxes we’ve navigated in this age of remote work, it entraps the performer in an echo of the larger crisis of confinement that emerged in the early days of COVID. Those formative weeks in lockdown, characterized by isolation and loneliness, spurred our earliest experiments in digital performance, and by continuing to hit our heads against the walls of what is possible, my collaborators and I have developed a practice that both embraces and aestheticizes the challenges presented by these creative, technical, and indeed literal limitations. We ask how this utilitarian container, so uncomfortably small, can become a stage for the imagination, harnessing technology to introduce tools that expand our very concept of what’s theatrically possible.

This process was borne out of the desire to keep creating at a time when the theater industry was shut down and technology became not only a vital lifeline but an essential storytelling tool. Embracing 21st century solutions to the question of “what is “theatrical?” Theater in Quarantine integrates creative technology with the body in motion, finding tactility and dynamic physicality even in remote performance. We ask how it’s possible for a digital encounter to feel both intimate and immediate, challenging ourselves to reassert the liveness of our form in even the most mediated of circumstances.

The Greatest Liberty,Charles Murdock Lucas,Home26,"This production was presented as part of Our Voices: Immersive Composer Collaborations, a series at the Eastman Opera Theatre. The series immersed the singers, designers, directors, and technicians in a collaborative process with six influential contemporary composers. The singers and composer were involved in the design process from the very start, in contrast to some traditional production modes. Each composer curated the production in collaboration with the artistic staff. The composer for this production was Anthony Davis, and the production consisted of several arias from various full length operatic works composed by Davis.

The pandemic required that the team use creativity to overcome adversity in production. In the depths of the pandemic, rather than retreat into the comfort of the familiar, this production advanced a series of viewpoints rarely explored in opera to confront conflicting ideas of what makes a community.

The result of this collaboration was a streamed video performance presented as a gallery of unique American experiences and identities comes to life in singing portraits. This socially conscious collection of work was produced using video editing, animation, and digital painting techniques, some of which were enhanced with machine learning animation.

This was produced with the strictest safety precautions during the pandemic. For example, the performer did not share the performance space with any persons during remote filming.

The pandemic allowed us to step back, re-examine the stories that were being told in opera, and re-center the conversation around stories infrequently presented in the artform. The constraints on the production process allowed us to innovate in how we presented these characters to the audience as well, which created a uniquely confrontational performance style","Eastman Opera Theatre

Sweet Land,Hana Kim,Home27,"In Sweet Land, the audience took on the role of the Arrivals, who have arrived onshore to meet another civilization, the Hosts. Guided through L.A. State Historic Park, audience members were separated into diverging tracks across the space to experience different storylines and perspectives. Starting as a procession through the LA State Historic Park, Sweet Land becomes an opera that erases itself.

The opera poses a question of American origin myth. As a creative team, we had to embrace the didactic direction and leave it open for interpretation. To a degree, we had to embrace the chaos and confusion of the unanswered question, ‘What is America?” The show was slated to run in March 2020, which was cut short due to the covid19 pandemic. However, the question of American identity echoed through civil uprisings in the next couple years and became more than ever timely.

Over the course of the opera, I wanted the video design to continually fade into evermore indistinct representations of history. The projections are almost like ghosts themselves, the video design is not solid. The projections don’t guide the story arc, but they do act as a unifying force. The video opens and ends the story but does not get into the specifics of the story. The audience only sees projections when the whole of them are together, not during their separate tracks.

“Sweet Land began in the scene called The Contact, where projections were displayed on a scrim surface, with a faint background of city lights seeping through. At The Crossroads, a mythical landscape, ghostly projections were displayed on water mist. The show concluded at the Boneyard for the final projections in the scene Echo and Expulsion, where the city environment itself was used as projection surfaces, including 360′ span of North Broadway Bridge facade, 40′ by 12′ billboard sign, abandoned piece of woods and plastics in the construction site nearby the park.”

After Unica,Jeromy Hopgood,Home28,"The design for After Ünica was a rare experience as a designer, creating a 90-minute projection design that ran in realtime alongside the work’s creator on this devised solo experimental theatre piece. The piece was inspired by Unica Zürn, the German Surrealist writer and artist best known for her anagrammatic poems and automatic drawings. Her work was closely identified with her own mental illness, her traumas, her partners, and her suicide. As the son of a mother who took her life by suicide, also, the author Malcolm Tulip was drawn to her work and interested in the conflation of her identity, illness, and her art.

The concept for this work was to create a devised performance addressing the links between the artist and mental health. Rather than seeking to be a “docu-performance” about Zürn, Tulip wanted the creative process to be guided by anagrams (a given set of elements which, when reassembled give new meanings), automatism (actions which when performed without thought or conscious intention reveal untapped personal dialogues), and chance.

Zürn, while in a forced stay at a mental hospital, took several versions of the Wartegg Test (a psychological diagnostic tool that involves drawing inside eight square boxes). Using the Wartegg Test itself as inspiration, the set design was a 3-dimensional representation of the test as a cube inside which Tulip performed the show. Three sides of the cube served as projection surfaces, allowing the projection design to completely surround Tulip and respond in synchronicity with his performance. My design conveyed a sense of the traps, surprises, ecstasies, and horrors that ebb and flow within the human brain when one’s “sanity” moves between balance and imbalance.

My design for this show embraced a unique storytelling process, allowing the audience to experience the voices of the often under-represented and misunderstood community of those with mentally illness. In particular, it also allowed me to acknowledge the stories of women born within a systemic patriarchal power structure and illuminate their struggles. It was a rare privilege and responsibility to create a design that embodied and represented these voices through our performance.","Writer & Performer – Malcolm Tulip
